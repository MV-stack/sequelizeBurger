# sequelizeBurger

### Overview

The SequelizeBurger app uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and Sequelize. The app follows the MVC design pattern; which uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

### How the app works

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The app will store every burger in a SQL database, whether it is devoured or not.
